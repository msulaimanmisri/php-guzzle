## About This Project

- This project is actually for me to refresh my knowledge using Guzzle HTTP in Vanilla PHP.
- This simple web application is a life-saver when it comes to search for image that you wanted.

## How to use

- Fork or clone this repository to your own local machine.
- Copy the `env.php.example` and rename it to `env.php`.
- Make sure you put your own unsplash developer `Access Key` inside the `env.php`
- Simply key-in your image keywords in the input (or search bar) inside the application. Then it will return the images that contains the keyword that you entered.
- Then you can right-click the image to see a few options that you can use. Such as `copy clean link`, `copy image address` and much more.
